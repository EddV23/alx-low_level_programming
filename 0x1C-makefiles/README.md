# 0x1C. C - Makefiles

# Project: Makefiles and Island Perimeter

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of Make and Makefiles.
- Learn when, why, and how to use Makefiles.
- Explore rules in Makefiles, including explicit and implicit rules.
- Utilize common and useful rules in Makefiles.
- Define and use variables in Makefiles.

## Requirements

- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **GCC Version:** 9.3.0
- **Make Version:** GNU Make 4.2.1
- **File Requirements:**
  - All files should end with a new line.
    - Include a README.md file at the root of the project folder.

## Project Structure

- **0-Makefile:** [Makefile](./0x1C-makefiles/0-Makefile) - Create your first Makefile.
- **1-Makefile:** [Makefile](./0x1C-makefiles/1-Makefile) - Makefile with variables for the compiler and source files.
- **2-Makefile:** [Makefile](./0x1C-makefiles/2-Makefile) - Useful Makefile with separate rules for compilation.
- **3-Makefile:** [Makefile](./0x1C-makefiles/3-Makefile) - Makefile with additional rules (clean, oclean, fclean, re).
- **4-Makefile:** [Makefile](./0x1C-makefiles/4-Makefile) - Complete Makefile with compiler flags.
- **5-island_perimeter.py:** [Python Script](./0x1C-makefiles/5-island_perimeter.py) - Python script for calculating island perimeter.
- **100-Makefile:** [Makefile](./0x1C-makefiles/100-Makefile) - Advanced Makefile with additional constraints.

## Usage

To build and execute the programs, use the following commands:

```bash
make -f <Makefile_name>
./<executable_name>
```

### Example:

```bash
make -f 0-Makefile
./school
```

## Notes
- Ensure that the required versions of GCC and Make are installed on your system.
- All files end with a new line as per project requirements.
- The Python script `5-island_perimeter.py` does not use any external modules and follows specific requirements.


## Happy coding!
